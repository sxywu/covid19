    "explanation1": "The first cases of a global pandemic have arrived in your backyard. Because the disease can be transmitted before symptoms appear, it has the potential to spread throughout the entire community—unless you take action now through physical distancing. The next 8 weeks are crucial for saving thousands of lives.",

    "explanation3": "This game uses the decisions of 20 players—you and 19 other people who have played before—to determine how frequently people in your community leave their homes over the next 8 weeks. Each player’s choices will influence how 5% of the population behaves.",
